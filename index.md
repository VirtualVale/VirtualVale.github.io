## Biography 
<a name="biography"></a> 

Hi, I am Valentin Spannagl. At the end of 2022 I finishes my master program [Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/robotics-cognition-intelligence-master-of-science-msc/) at the [Technical University Munich](https://www.tum.de). The symbiosis of robotics and artificial intelligence fascinated me and now I am looking for a interesting job in this field. Prior to my time in munich I studied [Ingenieurinformatik](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/de/studium/studienangebot/uebersicht/ingenieurinformatik-bsc/) at the University in Augsburg. 
During my bachelor I was employed at the Chair of Production Informatics in Augsburg. I worked on a variety of projects including augmented reality, additive manufacturing and mobile robot platforms. The latter were also the main component of my bachelor thesis. The scope of my master thesis was federated learning, which was applied on the driver monitoring use case.
